</body>
<body>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Video, as a more advanced information carrier, has gradually become the new preference of storing and sharing information in daily life. During the recording of videos, the cameras are inevitably occluded by some objects or persons that pass through the cameras, and searching out such occlusions would highly increase the workload of video editors. In this paper, we propose a frame-based video occlusion detection method, which is a fundamental component of automatic video editing. The proposed method enhances the extraction of spatial-temporal information based on C3D yet only using around half amount of parameters. And an occlusion correction algorithm is implemented to correct the prediction results. In addition, we introduce a novel loss function to better extract the characterization of occlusion and improve the detection performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which focuses on occlusion detection for automatic video editing. <br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To evaluate our solution, we build a new large scale dataset, which contains 1,000 video segments from seven different real-world scenarios, including academic conferences, annual conferences, movies, panel speak, etc. All occlusions of the video segments are annotated frame by frame with bounding-boxes so that the dataset could be utilized in both frame-level occlusion detection and precise occlusion location. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method could achieve good performance on video occlusion detection compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</body>
